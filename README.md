# Repository for the Stanford Deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialisation.

##### This repository has the assignment lab notebooks that I had to complete in the specialisation.
##### I have learned about neural networks and deep learning from this specialisation.
##### The notebooks implement basic single layer to complex multi layer neural networks.
##### Implementation has used the data analysis and machine learning libraries along with TensorFlow(Keras) for deep learning.
